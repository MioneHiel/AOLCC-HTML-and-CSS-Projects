# AOLCC-HTML-and-CSS-Projects

 These are the sample projects I have created and finished:

 Dream Builders website. 
   This is an example home page  for a Construction builders company specializing in Home building and renovation. It was styled using CSS and contains a navbar,       image containers and a form.

   
Movie Theater website. 
  This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap. It contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
