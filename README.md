# AOLCC-HTML-and-CSS-Projects

 These are the sample projects I have created and finished:

 Dream Builders website. 
   This is an example home page  for a Construction builders company specializing in Home building and renovation. It was styled using CSS and contains a navbar,       image containers and a form.

   
Movie Theater website. 
  This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap. It contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
 

Live Website Project. 
 This page is all about my personal portfolio. It was styled using CSS and it incorporates all my learnings in Web development so far. It is a live website using GitHub.io
